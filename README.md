# 🌱 Soil pH Tracking Web-App 🌾

## Overview
The **Soil pH Tracking Web-App** is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help users estimate and track soil pH levels by uploading images of soil samples. It provides insights into soil acidity and alkalinity, helping users optimize plant growth conditions.

## Features
- 📸 **Drag & Drop Soil Image Upload**: Users can upload an image of the soil sample for analysis.
- 📍 **Enter Location**: Option to specify the soil's location for reference.
- 🔍 **Estimated pH Level**: Provides an estimated soil pH value.
- 🌾 **Soil pH Type**: Categorizes the soil as acidic, neutral, or alkaline.
- 📜 **Submit Report**: Users can submit soil reports for tracking purposes.
- 📊 **Recent Reports**: View previously submitted soil samples for comparison.

## Understanding Soil pH
Soil pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of soil, significantly affecting plant health and growth:
- **Acidic (pH < 7)**: Suitable for blueberries, azaleas, and rhododendrons.
- **Neutral (pH = 7)**: Ideal for most crops.
- **Alkaline (pH > 7)**: Supports plants like asparagus and spinach.

**Tip:** Regular soil testing helps maintain optimal soil conditions. Use **lime** to raise pH or **sulfur** to lower pH.

## Future Enhancements
🚀 **Backend Integration** (Upcoming):🚀
- Implementing a database🧾 for storing user-submitted reports.
- AI-based💻 image processing for more accurate pH estimation.
- 🔒User authentication🔐 for personalized soil tracking.
